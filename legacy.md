# On the use of gender as a variable in Computer Graphics research

## Questions

- Should gender be a variable at all?

- If the answer is yes, how should this variable be represented mathematically?

## Why do we care?

In all of the published Computer Graphics literature I've reviewed, ``gender'' is often used as a variable and, when it is, it is treated as a binary proxy for a set of physical characteristics.
