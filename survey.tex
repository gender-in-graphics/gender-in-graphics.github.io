%\begin{abstract}
%    We survey the treatment of sex and gender in the Computer Graphics research
%    literature and its scientific and real-world consequences. We conclude
%    current trends on the use of gender in our research community are scientifically incorrect and constitute a
%    form of algorithmic bias with harmful effects. We propose ways for
%    correcting these trends and pose novel research questions.

\section{Methodology}

We reviewed all technical papers published on ACM Transactions on Graphics and
presented at either of the North American or Asian editions of SIGGRAPH between
January 2015 and December 2021, and recorded all of those that contained
explicit mentions of sex or gender.

\section{Observations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item discrete binary variable: no mention of non-binary people
    \item observed works never mention the existence of gender-non-conforming people and we found no work that explicitly attempted to correct the effect of them being underrepresented in comparison to gender conforming people.
    \item when gender appears as a feature or target variable in an algorithm, it is always as a proxy, but what it is a proxy of varies through the literature: . Furthermore, some papers combine several proxies into one.
    \item observed works that propose gender classifiers and/or used annotated gender data
    \item user studies with unknown option
\end{enumerate}
